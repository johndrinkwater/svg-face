Just playing about with SVG and media queries. This has been sat on my harddisk
since the start of the year (and my head since 2010) waiting for bugs to be
resolved in browsers, they are getting close, and we poked them along a bit
with http://johndrinkwater.github.io/svg-media-queries/ so putting this live.

This is the Avatar/.face I have used for the last decade+ in PNG form, that I
decided to make a bit more dynamic in SVG. It should change appearance
depending on requested size.

Nothing is especially new, and the code is kinda obvious, so any blogging will
wait til I actually start doing that again :P

This, like the rest of my non-code, is licensed CC BY-SA. Though I cannot
expect you will want to replicate my face entirely, do learn something from it,
eh?
